# Quantum Support Vector Machine

This work focuses on the case of Classical data using Quantum algorithms. In this
experiment, we use the IBM Qiskit library to study how well a quantum machine
learning classifier works. The dataset used in this work is the WDBC dataset
taken from the Penn Machine Learning Benchmarks (PMLB) library. The QSVM
is a robust supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification. Fast
computation is achieved by reducing the dimension of the data using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) on the classical data and then loading the classical
data into a quantum kernelized support vector machine algorithm.
